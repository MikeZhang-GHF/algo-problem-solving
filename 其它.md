- Next Permutation
> "next permutation" refers to the lexicographically next greater permutation of a sequence. In simpler terms, it means finding the arrangement of elements in the sequence that comes just after the current arrangement in lexicographical order.
> In lexicographical order, elements are compared from left to right, and the comparison is done based on their numerical values. For example, for sequences of integers, the lexicographical order is the same as the numerical order.
> For a given sequence, there can be multiple permutations of its elements. The "next permutation" is the permutation that is immediately greater than the current permutation in lexicographical order. If no such permutation exists, it means the current permutation is already the last one, and the "next permutation" will be the first permutation.

> 根据上面的描述，进行模拟。

```python
class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        n = len(nums)
        i = n - 2
        # 从后往前找到第一个不满足递减的数
        while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i+1]:
            i -= 1

        if i >= 0:
            # 从后往前找到第一个比nums[i]大的数，就是下一个排列
            j = n - 1
            while i < j and nums[j] <= nums[i]:
                j -= 1
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        # 保持递增
        nums[i+1:] = reversed(nums[i+1:])
```
